- The overview of my project brings awareness to the negative impacts of system downtime. Every minute counts when you have an application relying heavily on data centers.  The average cost of system downtime *"across industries was valued at approximately **$5,600 per minute**."*<sup>[[a]](https://www.evolven.com/blog/downtime-outages-and-failures-understanding-their-true-costs.html)</sup> According to a 2019 survey, 25 percent of global enterprise companies *"reported the average hourly downtime cost of their servers as being between **$301,000 - 400,000 USD.**"*<sup>[[b]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/753938/worldwide-enterprise-server-hourly-downtime-cost/)</sup>
